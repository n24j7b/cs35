ECON 2112. PROBLEM SET 1 
DUE: 5 PM, SEPTEMBER   20   (FRIDAY)Note:   In   some   exercises   below   you   will   ﬁnd   the   expression   “pure   strategy”   .    By   this   we   mean   the   kind of   strategies   that   we   saw   in   parts   I   and   II   of   the   Week   1 Lecture   Videos.   In   III   we   informally   introduced the   idea   of mixed strategies, which   we   discuss   in   detail   in   Week   2.
Exercise 1. Stag Hunt Game [3 marks] Two   individuals   go   out   on   a   hunt.    Each   can   individually   choose   to   hunt   a   stag   or   hunt   a   hare.    Each   hunter must choose one of these two   actions   without knowing   the   choice   of the   other.   The   only   way   of   hunting   a   stag   is   that   both   hunters   choose   to   hunt   it.   An   individual   can   always   get   a   hare   by   himself, but   a hare is worthless than a stag.   To be precise, each hunter will get a payof equal to three for successfully   hunting   a   stag.      A   hunter   will   get   a payof equal   to   one   for hunting   a hare.    Finally,   a   hunter   will   get   a   payof equal to zero if she does not succeed in hunting anything.(i)   Write   down   the   set   of pure   strategies   and   the   utility   functions   for   each   player.    (To   write   down   the   utility functions, you will need to   write   down   the   payof for   each player   associated   with   every   possible   strategy   proﬁle).
(ii) Write   down   the   normal   form   game   as   a   matrix.
(iii) Identify the set of   pure strategy   Nash   equilibria.
Exercise 2. Strategic Subsidies [4 marks] Airbus   (a   European   ﬁrm)   and   Boeing   (an   US   ﬁrm)   are   competitors   in   the   market   for   aircrafts.      The   demand   for   aircrafts   has   gone   down   signiﬁcantly   in   recent   times   -   in   fact,   so   much   so   that   only   one   player   can   proﬁtably   operate   in   the   market.    If   both   stay   in   the   market,   each   loses   $15   million.    If   both exit the market each gets   0,   where   as if one   stays   and   one   exits,   the   one   who   exits   gets   0   while   the   one   who   stays   bags   $100 million.
(i)   Write   down   the   set   of   pure   strategies   for   each   player.
(ii)   Write   down   the   normal   form   game   as   a   matrix.
(iii)      Compute the set of   pure strategy Nash   equilibria.Now   suppose   the   European   government   announces   and   credibly   commits   to   $16   million   subsidy   for   Airbus, contingent on Airbus not   exiting.   That is,   Airbus   will   receive   $16   million   as   long   as   it   remains   in   the   market   (note: this      means   $16   million   gets   added   to   Airbus’s   proﬁt/loss   ﬁgures   stated   above provided   it   stays).   How   does   this   afect   your   answers   to   (ii)   and   (iii)?
Exercise 3. Beyond two strategies [2 marks] 
Provide   an   example   of   a   2-player   normal   form   game   where   each   player   has   3 (pure) strategies   such   that:
(i)   There   is   no   pure   strategy   Nash   equilibrium.
(ii)   There are exactly three pure strategy Nash equilibria.   Identify   those three.
Exercise 4. Can AI do game theory? [3 marks] 
Bloom   a代 写ECON 2112. PROBLEM SET 1Java
代做程序编程语言nd   other   tools   which   use   generative   AI   can   sometimes   get   confused   and   make   errors   when   trying   to ﬁnd   the   Nash   equilibria   of   a   game.
(i)      Consider   the   output   below   which   is   a   variant   of   a   game   generated   by   an   AI   tool.
AI: Scenario: Two neighbouring restaurants, Bistro A and Cafe B, are deciding whether to invest in outdoorseating or enhance their indoor ambiance. 
• If both restaurants choose outdoor seating, they each achieve a payof of 6, beneﬁting from the extra ambience created by the other restaurant, but sharing the increased summer foot traﬃc. 
• If Bistro A chooses outdoor seating while Cafe B enhances indoor ambiance, Bistro A gets 7 and Cafe B gains less with 4, attracting less summer diners. 
• If Cafe B chooses outdoor seating while Bistro A enhances indoor ambiance, Cafe B gets 7 and Bistro A gets 4. 
• If both choose to enhance indoor ambiance, they each get a payofof 5. 
Is   the   game   the   AI   has   generated   an   example   of   a   prisoners   dilemma?   Why/why   not?
(ii)   Explain the error made by the student in the   following   transcript   and   rewrite   the   ﬁnal   response   from   Bloom   in   a   way   that   corrects   the   student’s   mistake.
Student: Solve the following game for pure strategy Nash equilibria. Bloom: Thank you for providing the speciﬁcs. Remember that a Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can unilaterally improve their payof by changing their strategy, given the other player’s strategy. Let’s start with identifying best responses for each player. Can you tell me what Player 1’s best response is if Player 2 plays Strategy A? What about if Player 2 plays Strategy B? Student: If player 2 plays A, the best response is X. If player 2 plays B, the best response is X. Similarly for player 2, if player 1 plays Xor Y the best response is A. So the unique Nash equilibrium is (X,A). 
Bloom: That’s absolutely correct! Well done! To summarise, the Nash equilibrium in this game is indeed at (Player 1: Strategy X, Player 2: Strategy A). This is a situation where neither player can improve their payof by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other player’s strategy.
The problems below are only for discussion in tutorials (if time permits); they will not be graded 
Exercise 5. Consider   the   following   two-player   normal   form   game.

Try diferent values of x and work   out Nash   equilibria   in   pure   strategies.   Does   this   game   always   admit   at   least   one   Nash   equilibrium   in   pure   strategies   (irrespective   of   the   value   of x)?
Now   replace   (2,   2) with   (y,   y) where   y   ≠ x.   Is   there   still   at   least   one   NE   in   pure   strategies?
Exercise 6. Deﬁnition 
Provide a formal deﬁnition for the following concepts:
(i) n-player   normal   form   game.
(ii)   Nash   equilibrium.
(iii)   A   player’s   best   response.
Exercise 7. Beyond two players 
Consider the following 3-player normal form. game

(i)   For   each   player, write   his   set   of   best   responses   against   every   strategy   proﬁle   of   his   opponents.
(ii)   Is   (T, L, W) a   Nash   equilibrium?   Explain.
